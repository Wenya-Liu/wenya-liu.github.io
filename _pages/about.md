Research interests
======
I am currently working on the 'Plasticity Stimulation in the Treatment of Anhedonia' project, which is funded by the [Wellcome Leap Multi-Channel Psych research program](https://wellcomeleap.org/mcpsych/). In this project, my work focuses on behavioural phenotyping with the digital therapeutic product Meliora, which is a novel video game for depression treatment. I also work on resting state MEG and fMRI analysis to study neural mechanisms of depression and the effects of video game on brain dynamics. My research interests also include multi-modal data mining, multiway analysis of brain imaging data, dynamic brain networks, and naturalistic paradigms.
