Education
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyväskylä under the supervision of 
[Prof. Tapani Ristaniemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OwGqX4AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), 
[Prof. Timo Hämäläinen](https://www.jyu.fi/it/fi/tiedekunta/henkilosto/henkilosto/hamalainen-timo) and 
[Prof. Fengyu Cong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Jd0dQA8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). 
I received the M.E. degree in Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology,
China in 2017 under the supervision of [Qi Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liqi/zh_CN/index.htm).


Research interests
======
My research dinterests include multi-modal data mining, multiway analysis of brain imaging data, brain network dynamics, and computational neuroscience. During my Ph.D. study, I focus on the altered functional connectivity in major depression under resting states and naturalistic task conditions, and I would like to apply the coupled tensor decomposition model to explore the abnormal brain networks in psychiatric disorders at the group level. I am also interested in developing advanced methods to reveal the dynamics of task-related brain networks.
