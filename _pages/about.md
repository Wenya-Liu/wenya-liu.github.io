Research interests
======
My research interests include multi-modal data mining, multiway analysis of brain imaging data, dynamic brain networks, and naturalistic paradigms. I am currently focusing on the altered functional connectivity in major depression under resting states and naturalistic task conditions. I would like to apply the coupled tensor decomposition model to explore the dysconnectivity of oscillatory brain networks in psychiatric disorders. I am also interested in developing advanced methods to reveal the dynamics of task-related brain networks and individual differences of brain networks in psychiatric disorders.
